# Declines in Disruptive Science

## August 30, 2024

One of the historically disruptive papers in virology is the 1970 paper by Howard Temin titled "RNA dependent DNA polymerase in virions of Rous sarcoma virus". This paper was significant as it identified transcriptase—a key enzyme enabling RNA to undergo reverse transcription into DNA— which was a groundbreaking discovery that disagreed with the theory of a unidirectional flow of genetic information from DNA, to RNA to proteins. The discovery of transcriptase shed light on the way retroviruses like HIV work and paved the way for the advancement of antiretroviral treatments that revolutionized the management of HIV/AIDS patients. This breakthrough became the foundation for molecular biology methods such as generating complementary DNA (cDNA) and employing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) which is an "everyday" tool in virology research.

In last 5 years, one of the most disruptive papers in the field of virology is the 2020 research paper by Zhou and colleagues titled "An outbreak of pneumonia linked to a new coronavirus likely originating from bats ". This study conducted an examination of SARS CoV–2，the virus that causes COVID–19 and established it as a newly discovered coronavirus closely associated with bat coronaviruses, providing insights into its genetic material which is essential for developing diagnostic tests and vaccines. The swift sharing and distribution of this data enabled scientists worldwide understand the structure of the virus and paved the way for the creation of vaccines in a very short period of time. This research enhanced our knowledge of coronaviruses and transformed the field of vaccine development.

The disruptivness of virology research remains consistent as it evolves its focus over time. Today virology thrives on innovation spearheaded by cutting edge technologies like CRISPR for modifying genes, AI for drug development, and mRNA technology for vaccine creation. The recent COVID 19 pandemic has emphasized the consistent evolution of virology research. Discoveries that completely change our understanding viruses, like the discovery of transcriptase, may not happen very often; instead we're seeing a new type of "disruption” driven by combining different disciplines and fast technological progressions.

# Scientific Computation

## September 6, 2024

In my laboratory, scientific computing plays a minor role, however, we use tools like Excel for data analysis and management. From the open discussion, I noticed that my colleagues face challenges with Excel’s limitations for handling larger datasets or more complex analyses. Challenges arise in handling larger datasets or complex analyses, where Excel's functionality may be limited or cumbersome. 

Seeking advice from colleagues on the best tools for specific tasks seems the most beneficial, as it helps identify more efficient methods. Effective data management and real-time analysis ("working on data as you go") also seem essential. This ensures consistency and accuracy when processing data while storing it in applications like Dropbox along the way to avoid losing your files. Moving beyond Excel, integrating more specialized tools like R, Python, or other analysis tools could enhance data visualization making research more streamlined.

Collective knowledge-sharing has been a significant part of my academic growth. I believe this could prepare me to apply computation techniques in future work during my master's. As a non-thesis master's student, I don't have a project to gather and analyze data, however, i found this discussion very informative and hope to apply some of these tips to my collaborative efforts in my lab. 

# Peer Review

## September 13, 2024

Navigating conflicting reviewer feedback can be challenging but constructive. A significant issue is reviewer bias. Reviewers might bring their preferences into their evaluations, which can skew the input and lead to recommendations that may not be entirely objective. For instance, a reviewer might have a preference for a particular methodology or theoretical framework, Sometimes reviewers have been known to give feedback for personal gain such as by suggesting citations from their work. 

When faced with feedback that I disagree with, I would first evaluate the comments in the context of my manuscript's objectives and methodology. I would try to understand the thought process behind each reviewer's suggestions, considering whether their points may highlight areas of improvement I had previously overlooked. To manage discrepancies between reviewers' feedback, I would weigh the merits of each perspective against the evidence and arguments presented in my manuscript. 

In cases where feedback from one reviewer contradicts another, I address both sets of comments in my revision. I would draft a detailed response where I acknowledge the different opinions, justifying how I have chosen to address or incorporate their feedback. By clearly articulating my thought process and revising the manuscript to integrate the constructive elements from each reviewer's input, I would demonstrate my commitment to improving the quality of my research while maintaining the integrity of my original work. This approach will hopefully enhance the manuscript and foster a productive dialogue with reviewers, leading to a more refined publication.

# Predatory Journal

## September 20, 2024

Predatory journals undermine scientific credibility by bypassing rigorous peer reviews. This sometimes leads to flawed or false research getting published. In fields like virology, where good science is critical for public health, such publications can lead to harmful medical interventions or misguided policy decisions. These journals lower the standards of research, letting poorly designed studies gain legitimacy and affects governmental and public discourse.

As misleading studies from predatory journals are often picked up by media or shared on social platforms, the public perception of science also suffers. This creates confusion and chaos, especially when discredited research is presented alongside legitimate studies. Misleading COVID-19 treatment and prevention claims, such as those regarding hydroxychloroquine, are examples of how these journals have amplified misinformation, further complicating public understanding of scientific consensus. 

A notable example involved a retracted paper from MDPI’s Viruses journal, which falsely claimed that the spike protein in COVID-19 vaccines impaired DNA repair. Despite its retraction, the study was widely used by vaccine skeptics to spread misinformation. Similarly, another retracted paper from MDPI's Vaccines journal falsely claimed that vaccine risks outweighed the benefits, further fueling vaccine hesitancy. These examples show the role of predatory journals in spreading misinformation and damaging public trust in science.

# Collaborative Research and Authorship

## September 27, 2024

This situation presents a challenge concerning authorship ethics, which can become contentious in collaborative research. If I were one of Dr. Andrews' collaborators, I would approach this situation cautiously, considering both the principles of fair authorship and the contributions of each individual to the research papers. I wouldn’t automatically agree to have Dr. Andrews as an author on every paper, especially if she had minimal or no direct involvement in the implementation, data analysis, or manuscript writing for these projects. While she played an essential role in securing the funding and the research idea, authorship should reflect intellectual contributions to the research process. If her involvement was limited to the initial stages of the project, it's not justified for her to appear on every paper unless her role in shaping specific studies or papers is clear.

Dr. Andrews' request is not unreasonable—she secured the grant and devising the original concept. It would have been much more straightforward had this expectation been communicated from the start. According to most authorship guidelines (like those from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, ICMJE), authorship is generally tied to “substantial contributions to the conception, design, execution, or interpretation of the data in specific studies.” In this case, if Dr. Andrews had little to no involvement in the research after the funding stage, automatically assigning her authorship on all papers could be considered unfair to those who made direct contributions.

To discuss this with Dr. Andrews, I would acknowledge her role in launching the project and securing the funding. I would explain that while her initial contributions are appreciated, the authorship of individual papers should reflect the contributions to each study and its associated writing. Dr. Andrews’ request reflects the tricky nature of collaborations and authorship expectations. She played an essential role at the project’s inception, authorship decisions should follow established guidelines, and recognition should be given to those who contributed significantly to the research and writing process. A conversation, focusing on transparency and authorship ethics, would be the best way to resolve the situation.

# Sharing Data

## October 4th, 2024

Sharing manuscripts on pre-print servers before journal acceptance is a popular strategy for promoting open science. One advantage is the ability to disseminate research findings quickly, allowing other scientists to access and build upon new knowledge. This fosters collaboration and accelerates scientific progress. Pre-prints allow authors to receive early feedback from the broader scientific community, which can improve the quality of the final publication.

Pre-printing can sometimes lead to issues with journal acceptance, as not all journals are open to considering pre-printed work. The lack of formal peer review on pre-print servers means that the research might be cited or used before it has been thoroughly vetted, which could spread misleading or incorrect information. There is also the potential for plagiarism or misuse of ideas when work is publicly accessible before formal publication.

I believe the benefits of pre-printing outweigh the risks, and I would consider using pre-print servers for future manuscripts. The ability to share my work with the community early and engage in open feedback seems valuable in fast-moving fields such as virology. I would be cautious about selecting an appropriate journal that allows pre-prints to avoid complications during submission.
